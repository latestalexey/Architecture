    documentation="The Grid-to-Grid hydrological model is a tool developed by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) for translating rainfall into river flows to predict potential river flooding. The model is configured on a 1km2 grid and can take better account of the location and intensity of rainfall forecast by high-resolution weather models, thereby allowing for targeted river flood warnings."/>

    documentation="As a forecasting duty officer I need the system to automatically create Local Flood Outlooks for pre-defined geographical extents that show flood alerts &amp; warnings together with counts where thresholds are forecast to be exceeded, or have been exceeded (or are close to doing so), as well as catchment/sub-catchment flood risk information and forecaster narrative, so that this information can be provided to customers of the service including Area Incident Management and National Flood Forecasting Duty Manager."/>

    documentation="As a system administrator I need to be able to see and control in one place a list of all forecasts that are currently running and their estimated arrival time (i.e. forecasts that are due to run and at what time, completed forecasts and how long they took to run, and forecasts that have failed and why) so that I can assess the activity of the system, suspend/cancel any scheduled forecasts that I think might impair overall system performance, can see which forecasts ran successfully and diagnose the problem with those that didn't."/>

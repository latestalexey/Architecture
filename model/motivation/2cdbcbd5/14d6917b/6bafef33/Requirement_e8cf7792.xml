    documentation="As a forecasting duty officer I need to access forecast information across different geographical areas (including where thresholds have been exceeded or are close to doing so) and drill down into more specific areas so that I can quickly get a view of the overall picture in a form that is consistent and concise at all levels (e.g. summary information, forecasts, warnings, stats) and can then concentrate on those areas that need my attention."/>
